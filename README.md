## Try Ballerine Now

**In the following example you can test a simple form of the following infrastructure capabilities**

1. Document collection flow
2. A manual review case management **Back Office**.
3. Live communication between the parts using a **Workflow Engine**, that also defines the process steps.
4. A simple JSON containing **Risk Rules** that are checked during the flow.

**Parts of the system you might look for but are not in THIS demo:**
- Our Plugin System and Rule Engine are still under construction and will soon be released.

To set up a local environment, follow these steps:

1. #### Install prerequisites:
   - Node.js (Minimum version 18) (you can install node via NVM: [Install NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
   - Latest PNPM version (Minimum version 8.0) ([Install PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation))
   - Docker and docker compose ([Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop), [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install))

2. #### Clone and install the project:

   ```

3. #### Run the example
   ```sh
   pnpm kyb-manual-review-example
   ```

Once the process is complete,  _2 tabs_   will open in your browser:

1. http://localhost:5201/ - for the _document collection flow_
2. http://localhost:5137/ - for the  _backoffice_
(It's recommended to have them positioned side-by-side).

**Steps to go over the flow:**

1.  On the collection flow tab, fill in the required fields each step
2.  Go through and complete the flow
3.  Go to the backoffice tab to review the new user that was created
4.  Approve/reject/ask to revision
