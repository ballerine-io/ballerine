## Getting started

Set up an onboarding decisioning workflow using Ballerina's pre-built building blocks. Collect data from users, process it with third-party vendors, automate decisions, or send them for manual review in the back office.

### Local Environment Setup

#### Prerequisites:
* Install Node.js ([Install NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
* Install the latest PNPM version ([Install PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation))
* Install docker and docker compose ([Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop), [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install))

#### Install:
   1. Clone the project:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ballerine-io/ballerine.git
   ```
   2. Install npm depenencies: 
   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```
   3. Initilazie monorepo: 
   ```sh
   pnpm monorepo:init
   ```
  
#### Run Examples:

##### KYC Manual Review Workflow: 
The following command will run the workflow's backend (workflow service API), the backoffice, and UI example using the headless web SDK:
```sh
pnpm kyc-manual-review-example
```

Once the process is complete, *2 tabs* will open in your browser:
the *backffice* and the *example KYC UI*
(It's recommended to have them positioned side-by-side).

##### KYB Manual Review Workflow: 
The following command will run the workflow's backend (workflow service API), the backoffice, and UI example using the headless web SDK:
```sh
pnpm kyb-manual-review-example
```

**Steps to go over the flow:**

1. On the KYC UI, click the "Start KYC" button
2. Go through and complete the flow
3. Go to the backoffice tab to review the new user that was created
4. Approve/reject/ask to resubmit
5. Get back to the KYC UI to see the result
