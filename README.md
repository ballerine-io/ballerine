## Try Ballerine Now

**In the following example you can test a simple form of the following infrastructure capabilities**

1. Document collection flow controlled by our **Headless SDK**.
2. A manual review case management **Back Office**.
3. Live communication between the parts using a **Workflow Engine**, that also defines the process steps.
4. A simple JSON containing **Risk Rules** that are checked during the flow.

**Parts of the system you might look for but are not in THIS demo:**
- Advanced Back Office - To try it out go to our [Case management back office page](https://github.com/ballerine-io/ballerine/blob/main/websites/docs/src/pages/en/learn/back-office.md).
- KYC/KYB UI flows - To try it out go to our  [Community driven building blocks page](https://github.com/ballerine-io/ballerine/blob/main/websites/docs/src/pages/en/learn/kit.md).
- Our Plugin System and Rule Engine are still under construction and will soon be released.

**Getting started**

To set up a local environment, follow these steps:

1. #### Install prerequisites:
   - Node.js (Minimum version 18) (you can install node via NVM: [Install NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
   - Latest PNPM version (Minimum version 8.0) ([Install PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation))
   - Docker and docker compose ([Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop), [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install))

2. #### Clone and install the project:
   1. Clone the project:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ballerine-io/ballerine.git
   ```
   2. Install npm depenencies:
   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```
   3. Initialize monorepo:
   ```sh
   pnpm monorepo:init
   ```

3. #### Run the example
   ```sh
   pnpm kyc-manual-review-example
   ```

Once the process is complete,  _2 tabs_   will open in your browser:

1. http://localhost:5173/ - for the _document collection flow_
2. http://localhost:5137/ - for the  _backffice_
(It's recommended to have them positioned side-by-side).

##### KYB Manual Review Workflow:
The following command will run the workflow's backend (workflow service API), the backoffice, and UI example using the headless web SDK:
```sh
pnpm kyb-manual-review-example
```
<sub>If the tabs have not opened automatically, please use the links provided above.</sub>

**Steps to go over the flow:**

1.  On the KYC UI, click the "Start KYC" button
2.  Go through and complete the flow
3.  Go to the backoffice tab to review the new user that was created
4.  Approve/reject/ask to resubmit
5.  Get back to the KYC UI to see the result
