### Why Open Source KYC/KYB & Risk stack?

The goal is to allow any company to manage user identity and risk in a way that suits them and their unique changing needs.
Main Open Source benefits:
*  **Future proof** - modular and extendable building blocks.
*  **Global** - Multiple vendors accessible in one UI and case management dashboard.
*  **White label** - Customizable UX and UI.
*  **Community** - Use what others have built, contribute yourself, and leverage community maintenance.


<details><summary>See some examples of what you can do with it</summary>


-  Use different vendors for different audiences - all modules are 100% vendor agnostic.
-  Create your own low-cost KYC with AWS Rekognition, Google vision, and other ML tools.
-  Collect documents in a KYB flow.
-  Implement and modify a case management for user approval/rejection.
-  And more.

If you currently don't have a commercial agreement with KYC vendors, you can use some of the vendors we already integrated with (Identity verification, AML check, etc.), to quickly start processing user's KYC requests. To do so please contact us at oss@ballerine.io.

# SDK UI Flows

### Description
With Ballerine's Web & Mobile SDK Flows you can generate custom-made, branded flows to collect KYC/KYB documents and user information.
The SDK UI is embeddable inside existing apps or deployed as a web app.

<img src="https://blrn-staging-assets.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/phones.png">

**Web SDK Benefits:**
* Pre-made KYC/KYB **Templates and UI Packs**.
* **Customizable UI** and flow to fit your desired experience and brand.
* **Vendor agnostic**, use different vendors in the backend.
* **Multi-platform support** (Desktop, mobile web, mobile native).
* Edges cases and **long-tail devices covered and tested**.
* Lightweight and performant, built with Svelte (**less than 50kb gzipped**).

<details><summary>Some examples of what you can do with it</summary>
	
-  Create a custom flow you can use with any identity verification vendor.
-  Create a custom flow that your customers can receive in an SMS.
-  Create different types of flows for different types of customers.
- And more...

# Case management (soon Open Source)


### Description
Give your operating team Ballerineâ€™s case management dashboard so they can approve or reject users, initiate workflows for document re-upload or escalate cases to others in the company. 

* A case management dashboard to approve, reject or classify users manually.
* Create workflows operators can trigger from the interface.
* Optimize manual work by customizing the layouts and information presented.
* Use as a standalone tool or embed in your existing dashboard.

<br/>

> *We are working on releasing our case management dashboard as Open-Source. Join our mailing list in the button below to get an update once it's out.*

# Workflow builder & Rule engine (WIP)


### Description
Customize your identity and risk workflows in code or with a low-code platform non-technical staff can play with.

* Test out different vendors to optimize conversion and costs.
* Utilize data sources and tools contributed by Ballerine or the community.
* Visualize complex flows to provide observability of how things work to the rest of the company.

<br/>

> *Our rule engine is still in development. Join our mailing list in the button below to get an update once it's out.*

| `endUserInfo` | [EndUserInfo]()| Use data like ID, name etc.. |
| `backendConfig`  | [FlowsBackendConfig](#backend-configuration) |Backend endpoint the flows should interact with|
| `translations` | [FlowsTranslations](#translations) | Change the config after init function|


#### Embedded Flows
CDN:
Add this code to your index.html header
```javascript
// 1. Add script (see installtion)
// 2. Initialize SDK & flows (see configuration)
BallerineSDK.flows.init({...}).then(() => {
	console.log('flows ready');
	// 3. Mount selected flow on an element
	BallerineSDK.flows.mount('my-kyc-flow', 'flow-host-element', {});
});
// 4. Listen to finish event (see events)
BallerineSDK.flows.on('finish', doSomethingFn)
```
[example folder]()

Package Manager:
```javascript
import { flows as ballerineFlows } from '@ballerine/web-sdk';

await ballerineFlows.init({...}).then(() => console.log('flows ready'));
// 3. Mount selected flow on an element
ballerineFlows.mount('my-kyc-flow', 'flow-host-element', {});
// 4. Listen to finish event (see events)
ballerineFlows.on('finish', doSomethingFn)
```
[example folder]()
	
#### Standalone/Iframe Flows
Code example:
```html
<script
  src="https://cdn.ballerine.io/js/1.1.33/ballerine-sdk.umd.js"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>
<script>
	const initConfig = {
		"flows": { "my-kyc-flow": {
		    "steps": [
			{"name": "welcome", "id": "welcome" },
			{ "name": "document-selection", "id": "document-selection",
			    "documentOptions": ["id_card", "drivers_license", "passport"]},
			{ "name": "document-photo", "id": "identity-document-shot" },
			{ "name": "check-document", "id": "identity-document-user-check" },
			{ "name": "document-photo-back-start", "id": "document-photo-back-start"},
			{ "name": "selfie", "id": "selfie"},
			{ "name": "check-selfie", "id": "check-selfie" },
			{ "name": "loading", "id": "custom-loader" }
		    ]}
		}
	}
	BallerineSDK.flows.init(initConfig).then(() => {
		BallerineSDK.flows.mount('my-kyc-flow', 'flow-host-element', {});
	});	
}
</script>
```

#### Native Mobile apps

All of the native functionalities happen inside Ballerine's native SDKs (Android & iOS Cameras, Sim checks, Fraud checks) while the representation layer is still a web app (inside a native webview).

This way we can enjoy both worlds:
* Web UI: Flexible UI that can be changed instantly from the server (no app deployments or store submissions). 
* Native APIs: Native camera, deep behavioral analysis, ekyc and more...

See Android and iOS repositories for guidance:

[Android SDK](https://github.com/ballerine-io/ballerine-android-sdk) | [iOS SDK](https://github.com/ballerine-io/ballerine-ios-sdk)
