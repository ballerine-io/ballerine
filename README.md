## Try Ballerine Now

**In the following example you can test a simple form of the following infrastructure capabilities**

1. Document collection flow.
2. A manual review case management **Back Office**.
3. Live communication between the parts using a **Workflow Engine**, that also defines the process steps.
4. A simple JSON containing **Risk Rules** that are checked during the flow.

**Parts of the system you might look for but are not in THIS demo:**
- Our Rule Engine is still under construction and will soon be released.

**Getting started**
To set up a local environment, follow these steps:
1. #### Install prerequisites:
   - Node.js ([Install NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
   - Latest PNPM version ([Install PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation))
   - Docker and docker compose ([Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop), [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install))

2. #### Clone and install the project:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ballerine-io/ballerine.git
   ```
  2. Install npm dependencies:
   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```
  3. Initialize monorepo:
   ```sh
   pnpm monorepo:init
   ```
3. #### Run an example
   * KYB
   ```sh
   pnpm kyb-manual-review-example
   ```
   * KYC
    ```sh
   pnpm kyc-manual-review-example
   ```
Once the process is complete,  _2 tabs_   will open in your browser:
1. http://localhost:5173/ - for the _KYB document collection flow_
   OR http://localhost:5202 - for the _KYC document collection flow_
2. http://localhost:5137/ - for the  _backoffice_
   (It's recommended to have them positioned side-by-side).

   <sub>If the required tabs have not opened automatically, please use the links we have provided above.</sub>

   **Steps to go over the flow:**

1.  On the collection flow, fill the required fields on each step
2.  Go through and complete the flow
3.  Go to the backoffice tab to review the new user that was created
   4. Sign-in with the following credentials:
      - **Email:** `admin@admin.com`
      - **Password:** `admin`
4.  Approve / Reject / Ask to resubmit
