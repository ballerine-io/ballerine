## Prerequisites

Before configuring SSL for your custom domain, make sure you have the following:

* A self-hosted Ballerine instance. See the [installation guides](/en/getting_started/introduction) for installing Ballerine.
* A domain name - You can get a custom domain from popular providers like GoDaddy, Amazon Route 53, Digital Ocean, NameCheap, and Domain.com.
* Ports 80 and 443 are open and accessible.

## Ansible

### Prerequisites

Follow the [ansible deployment guide](/en/getting_started/ansible_deployment)

### Setup your configuration vars for Ballerine:

Once the inventory is setup and want to deploy on HTTPS.

The next step is to setup necessary configuration for your app to run.

First you need to open `deploy/ansible/ballerine_playbook/roles/setup-ballerine/defaults/main.yml` file with your editor.
There are some variables that will need input from you to get the application start correctly

- `install_dir`: The absolute path of your app's installation folder on the server (required). Default: `/home/ubuntu/ballerine`
- `vite_api_url`: Incase you want to deploy ballerine on a remote server and run it on HTTPS
- `backoffice_url`: URL you wish to deploy Case-Management on
- `kyb_url`: URL you wish to deploy KYB on
- `workflow_dashboard_url`: URL you wish to deploy Workflows-Dashboard on
- `workflow_svc_url`: URL you wish to deploy Workflows-Service on

Once you complete setup config vars for your app then we are ready to deploy our app on your server.

**Run the Ansible playbook**:

After complete the above step. Now the only remain step we need to do is run the Ansible playbook.
You can run the Ansible playbook with the following command

<CodeBlock lang={`shell`}  code={`cd ballerine/deploy/ansible/ballerine_playbook;
ansible-playbook -i inventory.txt ballerine-playbook.yml`}/>

The command above will use the host information from the `inventory` file.

After performing these steps, make an entry of the domain name in your cloud provider.

The backoffice should be running on <CodeBlock lang={`shell`} code={`https://<backoffice_url>`}/>
