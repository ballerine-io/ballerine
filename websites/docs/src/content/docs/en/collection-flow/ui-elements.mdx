## Supported Elements

In the Collection Flow schema, various elements can be used to build the form pages. Each element type has specific properties that determine its appearance and behavior. Below is a detailed description of the supported elements and their respective options.

### `h1` - Title Component

The `h1` element is used to render a main title or heading on the page.

**Supported Options:**

- **text**: A string that defines the text content of the title.

### `h3` - Subtitle

The `h3` element is used to render a subtitle or secondary heading. It shares the same options as the `h1` element.

**Supported Options:**

- **text**: A string that defines the text content of the subtitle.

### `h4` - Tertiary Title

The `h4` element is used to render a smaller subtitle or tertiary heading. It shares the same options as the `h3` element.

**Supported Options:**

- **text**: A string that defines the text content of the smaller subtitle.

### `description` - Description Component

The `description` element is a paragraph (`<p>`) element that uses `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` for text rendering.

**Supported Options:**

- **descriptionRaw**: A string that defines the raw HTML content to be rendered inside the description element.

### `submit-button` - Submit Button

The `submit-button` element is responsible for setting all elements to touched, rendering errors if they exist, and primarily handles actions such as navigating to the next page or submitting the form.

**Supported Options:**

- **text**: A string that defines the text content of the button.

### `divider` - Divider

The `divider` element is a regular divider that takes up the whole width of the container.

**Supported Options:**

- This element does not have any configurable options.

### `json-form` - JSON Form

The `json-form` element is the base for rendering all input fields. It provides the structure and functionality needed to handle complex forms, including nested inputs and dynamic validation.

**Options:**

<CodeBlock lang="json" code={`{
  "options": {
    "jsonFormDefinition": {
      "required": ["first-name-input", "last-name-input"]
    },
    "label": "Your Label Here",
    "hint": "Additional information about the form",
    "canAdd": ["array-item-add-rule"],
    "visibleOn": ["visibility-rule"]
  }
}`}/>

- **jsonFormDefinition**: A piece of JSON schema, mostly used to define which fields are required so `json-form` can provide this flag to child element inputs.
- **label**: A string that defines the label of the form.
- **hint**: A string that provides a description or hint for the form.
- **canAdd**: A list of rules that check if new items can be added to the list (used for array-type forms).
- **visibleOn**: A list of rules indicating when the form should be displayed.
