## Introduction to Collection Flow

Welcome to the documentation for the Collection Flow feature. The Collection Flow is designed to streamline the process of gathering data from customers through dynamic, wizard-style forms. This feature leverages a custom schema format, enabling the creation of multi-step forms that adapt to the specific needs of your application. Each step in the wizard is represented by a schema, which defines the structure, validation, and user interface elements required for that step.

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Form Creation**: Define forms dynamically using a custom schema format. This flexibility allows you to tailor the data collection process to suit various use cases and requirements.
- **Wizard-Style Navigation**: Break down the data collection process into manageable steps, guiding users through a sequence of pages to ensure a smooth and logical flow.
- **Custom Validation**: Integrate JSON schema-based validation to ensure the collected data meets your specified criteria before allowing users to proceed to the next step.
- **Reusable Components**: Utilize predefined UI components and form elements, such as text inputs, date pickers, and checkboxes, to build consistent and user-friendly forms.
- **Action Triggers**: Define actions that are triggered based on user interactions, such as clicking a button, to perform specific tasks like updating user information or navigating to the next step.
