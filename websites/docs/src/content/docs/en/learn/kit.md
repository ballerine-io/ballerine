# Onboarding building blocks (community-driven kit)

</div>

Use the "community driven KYC/KYB process" to form flows and start onboarding clients.

What's included:
-  KYC/KYB flows and UI in Mobile & web SDK

Examples of what you can do with it:
-  Use different vendors for different audiences - all modules are 100% vendor agnostic.
-  Create your own low-cost KYC with AWS Rekognition, Google vision, and other ML tools.
-  Collect documents in a KYB flow.
- Customize your KYC flow to fit your brand and UI style.
-  And more.

<sub>* Please note that, although we regularly update it, Ballerine's "community driven KYC/KYB process" is a community offering and not our core product or service.
As such, we do not assume any responsibility for its use and do not consider it a part of our official services.</sub>










## UI Flows SDK


With Ballerine's Web & Mobile SDK Flows you can generate custom-made, branded flows to collect KYC/KYB documents and user information.
The SDK UI is embeddable inside existing apps or deployed as a web app.
