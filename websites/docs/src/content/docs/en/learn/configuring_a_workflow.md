## Creating a New Version/Updating a Workflow

To manage workflow definitions, you can find an interface  under the Workflow Definitions tab in [**Ballerine's Dashboard**](https://dashboard-sb.ballerine.app). Within this section, you can view and edit existing workflows using the JSON editors.

To modify a workflow, follow these steps:

1. **Locate the specific workflow** and click the "Edit" button next to the "Definition" JSON.
2. You will see two important options: **"Upgrade"** and **"Update"**.
    - The **"Upgrade"** button creates a copy of the current workflow definition and increments its version number, allowing you to make changes while preserving the original version. This is useful for introducing significant modifications or testing new features without affecting the existing workflow.
    - The **"Update"** button allows you to make changes directly to the current version of the workflow. This option is suitable for minor adjustments or bug fixes where creating a new version is unnecessary.

By providing these two options, Ballerine ensures flexibility in workflow management, enabling version control while allowing for quick updates when necessary.
