### Installation steps on a remote virtual machine

We recommend installation using Ansible

1. **Install Ansible**: We recommend installing Ansible with apt:
<CodeBlock lang={`shell`}  code={`sudo apt install -y ansible`}/>

2. **Clone the project**: Use Git to clone the Ballerine repository to your local machine:
<CodeBlock lang={`shell`}  code={`git clone https://github.com/ballerine-io/ballerine.git && cd ballerine`}/>

3. **Switch to the dev branch**: After cloning, switch to the development branch:
<CodeBlock lang={`shell`}  code={`git checkout dev`}/>

4. **Navigate to ballerine_playbook directory**:
<CodeBlock lang={`shell`}  code={`cd deploy/ansible/ballerine_playbook`}/>

5. **Create inventory file**:
<CodeBlock lang={`shell`}  code={`touch inventory.txt`}/>

Now, with your editor, open the file and add the hostname or FQDN of the server(s) you want to deploy Ballerine to with the following pattern:

6. **Add entries into the inventory file**:
<CodeBlock lang={`shell`}  code={`all ansible_host={{ SERVER_HOST }} ansible_port={{ SERVER_PORT }} ansible_user={{ SERVER_USER }}`}/>

If you are using SSH keypairs for authenticating your SSH connections to your server. You can tell Ansible your ssh private key file in the `inventory` file
using `ansible_ssh_private_key_file`

<CodeBlock lang={`shell`}  code={`all ansible_host={{ SERVER_HOST }} ansible_port={{ SERVER_PORT }} ansible_user={{ SERVER_USER }} ansible_ssh_private_key_file={{ SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE }}`}/>

After you completed the above step then we're pretty much done with the inventory


### Start Ballerine

**Run the Ansible playbook**:

After complete the above step. Now the only remain step we need to do is run the Ansible playbook.
You can run the Ansible playbook with the following command

<CodeBlock lang={`shell`}  code={`cd ballerine/deploy/ansible/ballerine_playbook;
ansible-playbook -i inventory.txt ballerine-playbook.yml`}/>

The default username and password for the backoffice are:

The collection flow on <CodeBlock lang={`shell`} code={`http://localhost:5137`}/>

**Username:**
<CodeBlock lang={`shell`}  code={`admin@admin.com`}/>

**Password:**
<CodeBlock lang={`shell`}  code={`admin`}/>


## Ballerine on HTTPS with ansible

### Prerequisites

Before configuring SSL for your custom domain, make sure you have the following:

* A domain name - You can get a custom domain from popular providers like GoDaddy, Amazon Route 53, Digital Ocean, NameCheap, and Domain.com.
* Ports 80 and 443 are open and accessible.

### Setup your configuration vars for Ballerine:

Once the inventory is setup and want to deploy on HTTPS.

The next step is to setup necessary configuration for your app to run.

First you need to open `deploy/ansible/ballerine_playbook/roles/setup-ballerine/defaults/main.yml` file with your editor.
There are some variables that will need input from you to get the application start correctly

- `install_dir`: The absolute path of your app's installation folder on the server (required). Default: `/home/ubuntu/ballerine`
- `vite_api_url`: Incase you want to deploy ballerine on a remote server and run it on HTTPS
- `backoffice_url`: URL you wish to deploy Case-Management on
- `kyb_url`: URL you wish to deploy KYB on
- `workflow_dashboard_url`: URL you wish to deploy Workflows-Dashboard on
- `workflow_svc_url`: URL you wish to deploy Workflows-Service on

Once you complete setup config vars for your app then we are ready to deploy our app on your server.

**Run the Ansible playbook**:

After complete the above step. Now the only remain step we need to do is run the Ansible playbook.
You can run the Ansible playbook with the following command

<CodeBlock lang={`shell`}  code={`cd ballerine/deploy/ansible/ballerine_playbook;
ansible-playbook -i inventory.txt ballerine-playbook.yml`}/>

The command above will use the host information from the `inventory` file.

After performing these steps, make an entry of the domain name in your cloud provider.

The collection flow on <CodeBlock lang={`shell`} code={`https://<backoffice_url>`}/>

The workflow service will be accepting calls at <CodeBlock lang={`shell`} code={`https://<workflow_svc_url>`}/>
