## Why Open Source KYC/KYB & Risk stack?

The goal is to allow any company to manage user identity and risk in a way that suits them and their unique changing needs.
Main Open Source benefits:

- **Future proof** - modular and extendable building blocks.
- **Global** - Multiple vendors accessible in one UI and case management dashboard.
- **White label** - Customizable UX and UI.
- **Community** - Use what others have built, contribute yourself, and leverage community maintenance.

See some examples of what you can do with it
</summary>

- Use different vendors for different audiences - all modules are 100% vendor agnostic.
- Create your own low-cost KYC with AWS Rekognition, Google vision, and other ML tools.
- Collect documents in a KYB flow.
- Implement and modify a case management for user approval/rejection.
- And more.

If you currently don't have a commercial agreement with KYC vendors, you can use some of the vendors we already integrated with (Identity verification, AML check, etc.), to quickly start processing user's KYC requests. To do so please contact us at oss@ballerine.io.
