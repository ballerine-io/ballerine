All of the native functionalities happen inside Ballerine's native SDKs (Android & iOS Cameras, Sim checks, Fraud checks) while the representation layer is still a web app (inside a native webview).

This way we can enjoy both worlds:

- Web UI: Flexible UI that can be changed instantly from the server (no app deployments or store submissions).
- Native APIs: Native camera, deep behavioral analysis, ekyc and more...

See Android and iOS repositories for guidance:
